//问题 A: Rails
//There is a famous railway station in PopPush City. Country there is incredibly hilly. The station was built in last century. Unfortunately, funds were extremely limited that time. It was possible to establish only a surface track. Moreover, it turned out that the station could be only a dead-end one (see picture) and due to lack of available space it could have only one track.
//The local tradition is that every train arriving from the direction A continues in the direction B with coaches reorganized in some way. Assume that the train arriving from the direction A has N <= 1000 coaches numbered in increasing order 1, 2, ..., N. The chief for train reorganizations must know whether it is possible to marshal coaches continuing in the direction B so that their order will be a1, a2, ..., aN.
//Help him and write a program that decides whether it is possible to get the required order of coaches.
//You can assume that single coaches can be disconnected from the train before they enter the station and that they can move themselves until they are on the track in the direction B.
//You can also suppose that at any time there can be located as many coaches as necessary in the station. But once a coach has entered the station it cannot return to the track in the direction A and also once it has left the station in the direction B it cannot return back to the station.


//问题 B: ACboy needs your help again!
//ACboy was kidnapped!!
//he miss his mother very much and is very scare now.You can't image how dark the room he was put into is, so poor :(.
//As a smart ACMer, you want to get ACboy out of the monster's labyrinth.But when you arrive at the gate of the maze, the monste say :" I have heard that you are very clever, but if can't solve my problems, you will die with ACboy."
//The problems of the monster is shown on the wall:
//Each problem's first line is a integer N(the number of commands), and a word "FIFO" or "FILO".(you are very happy because you know "FIFO" stands for "First In First Out", and "FILO" means "First In Last Out").
//and the following N lines, each line is "IN M" or "OUT", (M represent a integer).
//and the answer of a problem is a passowrd of a door, so if you want to rescue ACboy, answer the problem carefully!


//问题 C: 看病要排队
//看病要排队这个是地球人都知道的常识。
//不过经过细心的0068的观察，他发现了医院里排队还是有讲究的。0068所去的医院有三个医生（汗，这么少）同时看病。而看病的人病情有轻重，所以不能根据简单的先来先服务的原则。所以医院对每种病情规定了10种不同的优先级。级别为10的优先权最高，级别为1的优先权最低。医生在看病时，
//则会在他的队伍里面选择一个优先权最高的人进行诊治。如果遇到两个优先权一样的病人的话，则选择最早来排队的病人。
//现在就请你帮助医院模拟这个看病过程。
