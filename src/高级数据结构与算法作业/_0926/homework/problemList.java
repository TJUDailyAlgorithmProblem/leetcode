//问题 A: 绝对值排序
//输入n(n<=100)个整数，按照绝对值从大到小排序后输出。题目保证对于每一个测试实例，所有的数的绝对值都不相等。

//问题 B: As Easy As A+B
//These days, I am thinking about a question, how can I get a problem as easy as A+B? It is fairly difficulty to do such a thing. Of course, I got it after many waking nights.
//Give you some integers, your task is to sort these number ascending (升序).
//You should know how easy the problem is now!
//Good luck!

//问题 C: domino
//Little White plays a game.There are n pieces of dominoes on the table in a row. He can choose a domino which hasn't fall down for at most k times,
//let it fall to the left or right. When a domino is toppled, it will knock down the erect domino. On the assumption that all of the tiles are fallen in the end, he can set the height of all dominoes, but he wants to minimize the sum of all dominoes height. The height of every domino is an integer and at least 1.

//问题 D: Queue
//Little girl Susie went shopping with her mom and she wondered how to improve service quality.
//There are n people in the queue. For each person we know time ti needed to serve him. A person will be disappointed if the time he waits is more than the time needed to serve him. The time a person waits is the total time when all the people who stand in the queue in front of him are served. Susie thought that if we swap some people in the queue, then we can decrease the number of people who are disappointed.
//Help Susie find out what is the maximum number of not disappointed people can be achieved by swapping people in the queue.

//问题 E: EXCEL排序
//Excel可以对一组纪录按任意指定列排序。现请你编写程序实现类似功能。
