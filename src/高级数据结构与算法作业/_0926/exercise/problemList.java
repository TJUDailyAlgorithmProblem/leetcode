public class problemList {
//问题 A: 排序
//输入一行数字，如果我们把这行数字中的‘5’都看成空格，那么就得到一行用空格分割的若干非负整数（可能有些整数以‘0’开头，这些头部的‘0’应该被忽略掉，除非这个整数就是由若干个‘0’组成的，这时这个整数就是0）。
//你的任务是：对这些分割得到的整数，依从小到大的顺序排序输出。

// 问题 B: Who's in the Middle
//FJ is surveying his herd to find the most average cow. He wants to know how much milk this 'median' cow gives: half of the cows give as much or more than the median; half give as much or less.
//Given an odd number of cows N (1 <= N < 10,000) and their milk output (1..1,000,000), find the median amount of milk given such that at least half the cows give the same amount of milk or more and at least half give the same or less.


//问题 C: Ultra-QuickSort
//In this problem, you have to analyze a particular sorting algorithm. The algorithm processes a sequence of n distinct integers by swapping two adjacent sequence elements until the sequence is sorted in ascending order. For the input sequence
//9 1 0 5 4 ,
//Ultra-QuickSort produces the output
//0 1 4 5 9 .
//Your task is to determine how many swap operations Ultra-QuickSort needs to perform in order to sort a given input sequence.
