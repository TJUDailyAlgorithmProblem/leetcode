public class ABugsLife {
//Background:
//Professor Hopper is researching the sexual behavior of a rare species of bugs.
//He assumes that they feature two different genders and that they only interact with bugs of the opposite gender.
//In his experiment, individual bugs and their interactions were easy to identify, because numbers were printed on their backs.
//Problem:
//Given a list of bug interactions, decide whether the experiment supports his assumption of two genders with no homosexual bugs or if it contains some bug interactions that falsify it.
